# make up an imaginary knapsack

BACKPACK_SIZE = 250


# Here's an outline for using a genetic algorithm (GA) to solve the Knapsack problem:

# 1. Define the Problem and Set Up Parameters
# Knapsack Problem: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, select a subset to maximize total value without exceeding a weight limit.
# Parameters:
# Population size: Number of potential solutions (individuals).
# Mutation rate: Probability of mutating an individual.
# Crossover rate: Probability of combining two individuals.
# Generations: Number of iterations.

# need to make the number of potential solutions per generation

# need to make the mutation rate: probability of mutating an individual

# corssover rate: change of combining two individuals

# generations: number of iterations that we will run for
