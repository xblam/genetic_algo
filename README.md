# Ben Lam Genetic Algorithm

## Description
This is my implementation of genetic algorithm to solve the knapsack problem. The problem goes like this: given a set of boxes with assigned values and weights, what is the most value that I can pack into a knapsack of a given size?

My guidelines for project goes as follows:
- Define the problem as a **genetic algorithm**.
- Provide the **genome** structure for the problem.
- Define all the **fringe operations** (e.g., mutation, crossover).
- **Cull** the population by **50% at every generation**.


When ran, this program will give the best score that it can find for each generation that the simulation runs for. User can adjust the number of generations, population, mutation rate, boxes, etc at the top of the program
